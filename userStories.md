USER STORIES

As a Marketing Analyst...

I want to see quantifiable results for top images
I want a site that is clean, well-designed and user friendly
I want to show 3 images to users side-by-side
I want to view and analyze key engagement metrics for our images, in both a table and a pretty graph.
I want to give users the option to see final results, and count the number of users who chose to do so. However...
I want end-users to click on at least 15 products before being given the option to see their results
I want all images to show in the same way to the end-user, so that each user choice can be deemed statistically significant.

As a Developer...

I want to store each image (along with its properties) as a Javascript Object
I want to use a constructor to create my objects in order to save on needed performance
I want to use a responsive layout, to accommodate for use of different screen sizes
I want to use JS charting capabilities to present the data in a visual format
I want to devote the bottom half of the above-fold page to presenting engagement data
I want my code to be as DRY as possible


As an end-user...

I want clear instructions for what iâ€™m supposed to do
I want an option to see what I've liked so far
I want to move quickly through the images without a lot of loading time in between
I want to be able to use my different devices to view this web app
